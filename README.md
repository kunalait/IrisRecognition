# IrisRecognition
Iris recognition is a biometric identification method that uses pattern recognition on the images of the iris of an individual. Iris recognition is considered as one of the most accurate biometric methods available owing to the unique epigenetic patterns of the iris. In this project, we plan to develop a system that can recognize human iris patterns and an analysis of the results is done.


## Project Idea

The eyelids are a major factor while segmenting the iris. The approach can be

  i)	having a clear picture of the iris by having minimum interaction of the eyelids or

  ii)	 having an algorithm which doesn't take into account the part of iris which is occupied by the eyelids. 

Since having i) is quite difficult and requires ideal conditions, we used ii) as our current algorithm . 
We segment an iris and then select its that contour which is not under the influence of eyelids by specifying an angle. We can thus control the angle and thus the data and the accuracy of our algorithm.




## Intallation

Download the package to a local folder (e.g. ~/IrisRecognition/) by running:
  ```git clone https://github.com/PRML/PRMLT.git```
  
Run Matlab and navigate to the folder (~/IrisRecognition/), then run the init.m script.
