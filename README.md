# IrisRecognition
Segment an iris and then select its that contour which is not under the influence of eyelids by specifying an angle.


## Project Idea

Iris recognition is a biometric identification method that uses pattern recognition on the images of the iris of an individual. Iris recognition is considered as one of the most accurate biometric methods available owing to the unique epigenetic patterns of the iris. In this project, we plan to develop a system that can recognize human iris patterns and an analysis of the results is done.
